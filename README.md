# motivationFF

This repository contains different versions of a talk on the motivation in the [Freifunk](https://freifunk.net/) community (a community network project in Germany).
The talk is based on interviews conducted with members of the Freifunk community in the beginnings of 2016.
The interviews were conducted in German, so all translations to English are mine.
I apologise for any inaccuracies.

`ff_umfrage` is a file containing the raw interview answers (in German).


## paper

I'm also writing a [paper](https://github.com/lusy/motFossFf-paper) which tries to compare the motivations of the Freifunk and the FLOSS communities.

## attribution

I'd like to thank thousand times to all freifunk activists who've sacrificed their time to talk to me about the project and their motivations to participate.
