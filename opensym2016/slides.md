# Why have you started to participate in Freifunk? What's cool about the project?
  (Motivations overview / Otöne) --> vlt auch zu den jeweiligen "Kapitel" runterziehen

---

* "I liked the idea of connecting people in a decentralised, non-commercial manner"
* "It's a charming idea: to radio with each other, to do things with the network, to connect people in the hood, to do community based work (not only Internet related)"
* "it was the refugee context: I found it important to provide a communication infrastructure to people who don't have one."
* "I've founded it^^"
* "There was no (usable) Internet in Friedrichshain till 2003"
* "Intersection community -- technic is intriguing"
* "the legal regulations changed, so it was at once possible to freely deploy wifi networks"
* "I've learnt a lot about how communities work and don't, how much structure is helpful/not, what voluntary work means, what tasks get ignored and why, what should be decided at all costs and who decides, ..."

# Organisation of the findings

![motivations continuum](images/motivation_continuum.png)

Richard M. Ryan and Edward L. Deci, "Intrinsic and extrinsic motivations: Classic definitions and new directions", Contemporary Educational Psychology, 25:54–67, 2000.

## Extrinsic Motivation: expectation of a future reward

* no monetary compensation
* not seen as networking/visibility platform
* polish technical skills, learn about (wifi mesh) networks (6 of 16 people)
* "learnt a lot about network technic (there's scarcely another free time project where you can learn so much about it)"

~ (TODO: transition!) $\rightarrow$ byproduct, not a primary source of motivation

---

## Extrinsic Motivation: satisfying (personal) needs

* Before 2008: "There was no (usable) Internet in Friedrichshain in 2003"
* After: "share the own internet connection with people who need it! (today, primarily refugees)"

---

## Extrinsic Motivation: expected approval from self or others

* "it's cool to have the feeling that people need you"
* "you can see that people use it (refugees; students; positive feedback)"

---

## Extrinsic Motivation: feeling as a part of a community

* "building a project together with others"
* "I've grown to love the community"
* "collaborating with and getting to know people of different ages and backgrounds, which would have hardly happened in a different setting"
* "one gets to know interesting and different people, comes out of one's comfort zone and social bubble"
* the intersection of community and technology: the most interesting part of the Freifunk project

---

## Extrinsic Motivation: ideology

* 16 out of 16 people
* "free, decentralised communication infrastructure built and managed by the people who use it and not by the state or business players"
* "independent network, cannot be switched off by a single person"

~ (TODO: transition!) $\rightarrow$ political aspect plays a very central role

---

## Intrinsic Motivation

* technically interesting/challenging (14 out of 16 people)
* "there's stuff you can physically touch (more tangible compared to coding), it makes you happy :)"
* "you can climb on church towers and look at the city from above, which is pretty cool :)"
* "it's technically challenging despite the fact that I've abandoned the idea that it could be an alternative to the last mile of the German Telekom"
* "challenge: to get maximal results with minimal resources"

---

# Conclusions

* ideology is important motive for everyone in Freifunk
* differences in the motivations to join in different "generations" (pre/post 2008)
* evolve motivations over time? -- diverse project, many different aspects, keeping long time contributors possible
* asking more people and more elaborate questions would be interesting
* comparison between different projects would be even more interesting
