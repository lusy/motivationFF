<h1>Why have you started to participate in Freifunk?</h1>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<ul>
<li class="fragment">&quot;I liked the idea of connecting people in a decentralised, non-commercial manner&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;It's a charming idea: to radio with each other, to do things with the network, to connect people in the hood, to do community based work (not only Internet related)&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;it was the refugee context: I found it important to provide a communication infrastructure to people who don't have one.&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;I've founded it^^&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;There was no (usable) Internet in Friedrichshein till 2003&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;Intersection community -- technic is intriguing&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;the legal regulations changed, so it was at once possible to freely deploy wifi networks&quot;</li>

<h1>What's cool about the project? What's your primary motivation?</h1>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="project-community-work">Project / community work</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">&quot;from today's perspective: how big it has become&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;I've learnt a lot about how communities work and don't, how much structure is helpful/not, what voluntary work means, what tasks get ignored and why, what should be decided at all costs and who decides, ...&quot;</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="free-infrastructure">free infrastructure</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">&quot;there is a right to free communication and information&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;free, decentralised communication infrastructure built and managed by the people who use it and not by the state or business players&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;independent network, cannot be switched off by a single person&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;decentralised infrastructure is good, but it also makes things difficult&quot;</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="provide-access-to-internet-to-people-who-dont-have-it">Provide access to Internet to people who don't have it</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">&quot;There was no (usable) Internet in Friedrichshein in 2003&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;share the own internet connection with people who need it! (today, primarily refugees)&quot;</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="educational-mandate">Educational Mandate</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">&quot;a lot of people have learnt a lot about it infrastructure in this context&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;education: what's computer network, how does it work, how secure is it?&quot;</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="social-networking-community-feeling">Social Networking / Community Feeling</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">&quot;the community&quot; / &quot;the people&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;I've grown to love the community (not only in H, but everywhere)&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;social interconnectedness: (international) contacts made&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;one gets to know interesting and different people, comes out of one's comfort zone and social bubble&quot;</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="technically-interestingchallenging">Technically interesting/challenging</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">&quot;there's stuff you can physically touch (more tangible compared to coding), it makes you happy :)&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;you can climb on church towers and look at the city from above, which is pretty cool :)&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;it's technically challenging despite the fact that I've abandoned the idea that it could be an alternative to the last mile of the German Telekom&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;challenge: to get maximal results with minimus resources&quot;</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="broading-the-own-technical-know-how">Broading the own technical know-how</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">&quot;learnt a lot about network technic (there's scarcely another free time project where you can learn so much about it)&quot;</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="the-feeling-that-my-work-is-needed-and-valued">The feeling that my work is needed and valued</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">&quot;it's cool to have the feeling that people need you&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;you can see that people use it (refugees; students; positive feedback)&quot;</li>
</ul>

<section id="whats-not-so-cool" class="slide level1">
<h1>What's not so cool?</h1>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="sharing-knowledge-gets-neglected">Sharing knowledge gets neglected</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">&quot;the idea of sharing knowledge is not as focused as it should be&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;there are knowledge hierarchies, at the end people are not really glad to work without hierarchies&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;it's tough to have so much egos screaming for attention piled together&quot;</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="the-communicationdiscussion-culture">The communication/discussion culture</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">&quot;working in team is often difficult&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;when people think, they've found THE way and try to push it onto everybody else and seize control&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;if there are battles between single persons, it sometimes endagers the whole project&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;meetings with a lot of talking and little actions are annoying&quot;</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="gender">Gender</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">&quot;community consists primarily of men, it's difficult to open up&quot;</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="difficult-to-communicate-the-idea">Difficult to communicate the idea</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">&quot;it's difficult to convey the topic of informational self-determination to people outside the community. It's only starting to get more present in the current refugee context&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;there are users with a service mentality who only complain when stuff doesn't work but do not actively try to do something about it&quot;</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="technical-limitations">(technical) Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">&quot;unfortunately, the political idea is not really scalling (technically)&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;the whole project depends too much on the effort of single people; only few really do understand how it works and are able to manage it&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">&quot;it only gets technically interesting if the network grows, however, it then does attract the service mentality people and drives away the developers&quot;</li>

<h3 id="freifunk-is-technically-challenging-and-its-fun-to-work-on-the-project">Freifunk is technically challenging and it's fun to work on the project</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">10 yes</li>
<li class="fragment">1 it's not thaat challenging, but it's fun</li>
<li class="fragment">1 yeah... it's not the primary motivation; it's challenging but not always fun</li>
<li class="fragment">1 the technical part is rather boring</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="i-want-to-learn-the-technical-aspects-of-how-wifimesh-networksetc.-work">I want to learn the technical aspects of how wifi/mesh networks/etc. work</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">6 yes</li>
<li class="fragment">1 I had to, in order to implement the concept</li>
<li class="fragment">1 that wasn't my intention, but it happened at the end: &quot;x doesn't work, I want to fix it&quot;</li>
<li class="fragment">2 yeah, I wanted to learn individual aspects, but it wasn't my primary focus</li>
<li class="fragment">3 basically, I already knew how everything worked</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="i-wanted-to-learn-more-about-the-legal-framework-within-which-the-project-operates">I wanted to learn more about the legal framework within which the project operates</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">9 well, it's inevitable if you want to make the project work (not very enjoyable but important)</li>
<li class="fragment">2 noe, not really</li>
<li class="fragment">1 noe, I don't want to fit into predefined hierarchies</li>
<li class="fragment">1 it wasn't a motivation to join Freifunk, but it's interesting to deal with it</li>
<li class="fragment">1 it isn't uninteresting, but it's better if it's dealt with by people, who can do it better</li>
<li class="fragment">1 yeah (works on the lobby field, is politically motivated; not initial motivation, but it later became one)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">8 yes (3 of them affirmed pretty vigorously)</li>
<li class="fragment">2 yes (communication infrastructure in the hands of civil society; the industry has its own, the state too)</li>
<li class="fragment">3 yes (but I don't believe anymore that Freifunk can provide this completely)</li>
<li class="fragment">1 yes (note: it's difficult, if a lot of the decentralised infrastructure belongs to a single person)</li>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">2 yes</li>
<li class="fragment">10 no</li>
<li class="fragment">1 no, but I'll be shortly working on a project for a refugee shelter, where this is the case</li>

<section class="slide level1">

<h3 id="i-care-for-net-neutrality">I care for net neutrality</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">6 yes</li>
<li class="fragment">1 yes (but sensibility for this issue is not necessarily present in the Freifunk context)</li>
<li class="fragment">4 yes (but doesn't regard Freifunk as a struggle for net neutrality)</li>
<li class="fragment">1 yes (but to demand it at any price what is difficult and not particularly clever)</li>
<li class="fragment">1 yes (the Pico Peering Agreement is really important!)</li>
<li class="fragment">1 yes (one can at least try)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">9 no</li>
<li class="fragment">1 yeah, one can say there's something professionalI invest a lot of time and energy in the project and have on occasions received money for my work in this context</li>
<li class="fragment">1 I work professionally with wifi and mesh (not Freifunk); it was more a consequence of Freifunk than a motivation for collaboration</li>
<li class="fragment">1 I work professionally on wifi installations but try to keep both things separate</li>

<ul>
<li class="fragment">2 no (it was more the other way round: that was a field where I could apply the knowledge I already had)</li>
<li class="fragment">6 no</li>
<li class="fragment">1 no (but if I wanted to do wifi professionally, the Freifunk community would be a good networking platform)</li>
<li class="fragment">3 no (it surely happens, but it isn't a motivation for me to engage in the project)</li>
<li class="fragment">2 no (it's something I'd write on my CV, but it wasn't a reason for me to join)</li>
